Prerequisites, all platforms
---

R must be installed, along with the following packages from the CRAN: Rcpp RInside truncnorm shape.

The C++ library Boost is required, but is too big to be provided in the git repository. It must be downloaded from http://www.boost.org/ as an archive, and its content must be extracted in the boost subdirectory. The project directories hierarchy will then look like:

boost
  boost
  doc
  libs
  more
  status
  tools
eigen
gtest
MixtComp
RMixtComp

Prerequisites, OSX
---

The developper tools must be installed, by typing "xcode-select --install" in a terminal. This will provide a C++ compiler and a build toolchain.

Build and install
---

After the initial "git --clone", or after any update via "git pull" for example, the code must be rebuilt. To handle the various dependencies correctly, is is necessary to rebuild MixtComp by calling "./mcUpdate.sh" which is in the same directory as this present document. The script will clean just enough location to ensure a proper build without taking too long to complete.
