Before developping for MixtComp, the firectory structure must be created. In particular, symbolic links to the stkpp install directory must be created.

The following command must be run from the root directory of MixtComp:

STKPP_PATH=/home/modal/workspace/stk/stkpp ./createStruct.sh

Where the value assigned to STKPP_PATH has been replaced by the path to the stkpp directory (which must contains the directories bin, include, lib and projects).
