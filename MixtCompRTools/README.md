# MixtCompRTools

This package uses *JsonMixtComp* (old MixtComp version) to perform hierarchical clustering. It requires packages *roxygen2* for genetaring the documentation and *testthat* for unit testing.

```
install.packages(c("plotly", "doParallel", "RColorBrewer", "jsonlite", "foreach", "parallel"), repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com")
install.packages(c("roxygen2", "testthat"), repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com")
```
