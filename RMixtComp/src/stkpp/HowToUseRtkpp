Rtkpp is a small utility wrapper of the stk++ project when the library is used
in a R package. It does not provide any source except utilities for R and Rcpp
integration.


In order to use it:
1) copy rtkpp/ in the src/ directory of your package

2) rename it as stkpp. Choose 3) or 3').


3) cd in src/stkpp/ and create four symbolic links to the location of the stk++ directories
bin/, lib/, include/ and projects/, like in the following example:
$ ln -s ../../stkpp/bin/
$ ln -s ../../stkpp/lib/
$ ln -s ../../stkpp/include/
$ ln -s ../../stkpp/projects/

3') OR copy directly theses four directories in your src/stkpp/ directory.


4) in "makefile" comment (or uncomment) the stk++ projects you will use. If
you don't know which project you need, the default behavior should suffice.

5) Copy and adapt the files Makevars and Makevars.win from the Rutil directory
to the src/ directory of the R package you are working on.


When releasing your package, don't forget to explicitly copy the stk++
sources files if you have choose the step 3).
