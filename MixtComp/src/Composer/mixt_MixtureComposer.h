/** @ingroup Clustering
 *  Main class for handling composed mixture models.
 *  A composed mixture model on some composed space
 *  \f$  \mathbb{X} = \subset \mathcal{X}^1\times \ldots  \times \mathcal{X}^L \f$
 *  is a density of the form
 * \f[
 *     f(\mathbf{x}|\boldsymbol{\theta})
 *     = \sum_{k=1}^K p_k \prod_{l=1}^L f^l(\mathbf{x}^l;\boldsymbol{\lambda}^l_k,\boldsymbol{\alpha}^l)
 *     \quad \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{X}.
 * \f]
 * The \f$ p_k > 0\f$ with  \f$ \sum_{k=1}^K p_k =1\f$ are the mixing proportions.
 * The density \e f is called the component of the model. The parameters
 * \f$\boldsymbol{\lambda}^l_k, \, k=1,\ldots K \f$ are the cluster specific parameters
 * and the parameters \f$ \boldsymbol{\alpha}^l \f$ are the shared parameters.
