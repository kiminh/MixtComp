The makefile does not currently handle all kinds of dependencies. If a header is modified, only the source files bearing the same name will be recompiled. A "make clean" might be useful in more complex cases.
Check that STK has been compiled using -DSTKBASEARRAYS=0, so both packages agree on the data adressing.
There is currently no enforced dependencies to build the examples. They need the debug and release versions of the objects files to have previously been generated.
