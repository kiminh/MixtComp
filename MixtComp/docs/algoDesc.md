This file contains a summary description of the algorithms, and outline

The easiest way to understand how to program MixtComp might be to add a new model from scratch, and

The learning case is considered, because once it has been understood, the prediction algorithm becomes easy.

This is a general overview of the algorithm. If one method is called from another, it is shown with one additional level of indentation. Reading order is calling order.

- `mixtCompCluster`: the entry point for RMixtComp
    - `MixtureManager` constructor:
